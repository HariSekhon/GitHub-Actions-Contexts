# GitHub Actions Contexts

Dumps GitHub Actions contexts for debugging and exploring undocumented fields to be used in advanced GitHub Actions workflows.

Uses my [GitHub-Actions Reusable Workflows Library](https://github.com/HariSekhon/GitHub-Actions) where there is much more interesting and advanced stuff.
